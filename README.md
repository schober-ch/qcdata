This project aims at creating an easier way of organizing and accessing results from (quantum) chemistry calculations. The main purpose is to make this functionality optional and usable in addition to the standard terminal approach. 

It does not aim at a shared / collaborative / distributed repository, but just an additional way of finding/indexing quantum chemistry for a single researcher in his own files. Projects like http://quixote.wikispot.org/ might be better suited or provide a more general approach. 

In general, it will probably fail completely. I consider it an educational project for the spare time I have to learn more complex python programming. :-)
